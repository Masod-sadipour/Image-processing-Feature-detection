Finding Transformation Matrix in 4 pairs images

There are a bunch of white circles in each Figure. 

First: We want to find the position and the radius of each circle.

Second: There are two Figures in each pair, and Figure B is a transformation (translation, rotation, and dilation) of Figure A. 
Global transformation matrix was found for each pair of images.


Third: In pair 2,3,4 some circles of Figure A were lost in Figure B. Even though there is an overall correspondence between two Figures.

I have used python to solve this problem.
